# ERC2OWithFoundry
A simple implementation of the ERC20 token standard using Solidity and tested with Foundry

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/nwachee/ERC2OWithFoundry.git
cd ERC2OWithFoundry
forge build
```
# Usage

## OpenZeppelin

[OpenZeppelin Contracts Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)

[OpenZeppelin GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)

### Installing OpenZeppelin Contracts Package

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts 
```

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Testing
```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

#### 1. **Setup environment variables**

Create a ```.env``` file in the root folder:

```bash
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

**NOTE: FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A PRIVATE KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.**

#### 2. **Deploy**

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "transfer()"  --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```
or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```
